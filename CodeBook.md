###the UCI HAR Dataset working directory:

-activity_labels.txt are the descriptive names and id for the activity types found in the train and test data sets.

-features.txt are the descriptive names of the variables found in the train and test data sets

-activityData.txt is the final output of the run_analysis.R script

-in the test and train directory we have we have 3 data sets each that are to be merged to form the data with its corresponding subject id and activity id.

### Cleaning the data

-the script uses gsub to clean the variables  by replacing -std, -mean, bodybody  and - with Std, Mean, body. It also removes ’() and -‘.

this is the list of the mean and standard deviation variables cleaned:
